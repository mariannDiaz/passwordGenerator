The new Python feature: I used the secrets library to ensure every selected character in your password is safely managed through encryption/decryption.

Project Description: The Password Generator

This program can generate customized and safe passwords.

It has three main features:

    1. Generates a non-customized random password (let the sytem choose)
    2. Generates a memorable passphrase (made of random words)
    3. Generates a password from a sentence (Schneier's scheme)

Other features:

    - You can choose the length and types of characters you want to include in your desired password.
    - You can generate multiple passwords at once.


Main Challenges:

    1. Opening, reading and correctly managing the random words in the CSV file.
    2. To fully understand how to use the secrets.choice() tool inside the context of my program.
    3. To generate memorable but strong passwords. It is necessary to balance both requirements.
    4. To succesfully implement Brian Schneier's Scheme into a beginner friendly program.
    5. The biggest challenge was to make this program user-friendly, so the user has better control over the results they expect.


Details on how you tested that your project worked. For example, what inputs did you try to test it?
Put your short reflection (1â€“2 paragraphs):

What did you learned overall? A password should not be hard to remember or easy to decode. This statement can be highly contradictory.
