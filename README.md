# The Password Generator 

**Name: Mariann Diaz**


## 💫 The New Python Tool: secrets

  ▪️I used the secrets library to ensure that every selected
    character in your password is safely managed through cryptography methods. 
       

## 🗝️ Main features:
This program can generate customized and safe passwords.

    1️⃣ Generates a non-customized random password (let the system choose)
    2️⃣ Generates a memorable passphrase (made of random words)
    3️⃣ Generates a password from a sentence (Schneier's scheme)

## 🗨️ Other features:

    ▪️ You can choose the length and types of characters you want to include in your desired password.
    ▪️ You can generate multiple passwords at once.


## 💪 Main Challenges:

    🔹 To generate memorable but strong passwords. It is necessary to balance both requirements.
    🔹 Making this program user-friendly, so the user has better control over the expected results.
    🔹 To open, read, and correctly export the random words in the CSV file.
    🔹 To fully understand how to use the secrets.choice() tool inside the context of my program.
    🔹 To successfully implement Bruce Schneier's Scheme into a beginner-friendly program.


## 🛠 Debugging & Fixing:

    🔻 The program failed multiple times because of incorrect indentation, wrong conversion of values, issues with importing classes,
       incorrect management of the CSV File imports, and a lack of understanding of the secrets.choice() and "".join() tools.
       Later, I modified the program to function correctly using print statements and debugging. 

    🔻 Overall reflection: A password should not be hard to remember or easy to decode.
       This statement can be highly contradictory. I learned to balance both requirements in order to produce safe & memorable passwords.
